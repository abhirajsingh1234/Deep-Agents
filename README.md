# Deep-Agents
Build advanced AI agents from scratch with LangGraph! This repo provides 5 progressive notebooks covering task planning, virtual file systems, sub-agent delegation, and full research workflows. Learn the core patterns powering deep agents like Manus and Claude Code for real-world long-horizon tasks.


🧱 Deep Agents from Scratch

This repository teaches you how to build advanced AI agents step by step using LangGraph. Inspired by leading “deep” agents like Manus and Claude Code, it covers task planning, virtual file systems, sub-agent delegation, and context engineering patterns that enable long-horizon, production-ready agents.

📖 Course Overview

The repo includes five progressive notebooks:

0_create_agent.ipynb – Foundations

Build a simple ReAct (Reason-Act) loop

Quick setup and easy-to-use base agent

1_todo.ipynb – Task Planning

Structured TODO lists with status tracking

Progress monitoring and drift prevention

write_todos() for multi-step workflows

2_files.ipynb – Virtual File Systems

File operations: ls(), read_file(), write_file(), edit_file()

Context offloading to reduce token usage

Persistent memory across conversations

3_subagents.ipynb – Context Isolation

Delegate tasks to specialized sub-agents

Prevent interference via context isolation

Parallel execution for independent workflows

4_full_agent.ipynb – Research Agent

Combine TODOs, files, and sub-agents

Real web search with offloaded context

Summarization, strategic thinking, LangGraph Studio integration
